# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions to this year's edition of Advent of Code.

This time written in Node.js in TypeScript.

### How to use?

I wrote a simple script which generates new files for each day. To use it, run:

```bash
$ npm run day NUMBER [no-input]
```
When the `no-input` flag is used, `input.txt` will not be generated.

Now you can edit the files. When you are done, you can run the same command to execute your code.
